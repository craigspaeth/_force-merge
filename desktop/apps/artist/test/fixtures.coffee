His paintings and sculptures borrow widely from art-historical techniques and styles; although often seen as ironic or tongue-in-cheek, Koons insists his practice is earnest and optimistic. “I’ve always loved [Surrealism](/gene/surrealism) and [Dada](/gene/dada) and [Pop](/gene/pop-art), so I just follow my interests and focus on them,” he says. “When you do that, things become very metaphysical.” The “Banality” series that brought him fame in the 1980s included pseudo-[Baroque](/gene/baroque) sculptures of subjects like Michael Jackson with his pet ape, while his monumental topiaries, like the floral _Puppy_ (1992), reference 17th-century French garden design.",
