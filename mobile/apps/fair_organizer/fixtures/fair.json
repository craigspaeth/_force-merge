      "description": "Texts, like images, are central to representations and understandings of the world across cultures. As such, they have long appeared alongside images in artworks, and in some cases, are the artwork's essential characteristic. Ancient artifacts such as the [Rosetta Stone](/artwork/the-rosetta-stone-1) and the Code of Hammurabi demonstrate the long-standing role of texts in commanding political and moral authority, a tradition that continued, for instance, with the use of inscriptions on Roman monuments. In many cases, texts take on striking visual characteristics of their own: Egyptian hieroglyphics consisted of small, figurative symbols, elaborate Arabic scripts served as essential decorative elements in religious spaces where figurative representation was banned, and Medieval manuscripts often included exquisitely detailed lettering. Much more recently, text has played a central role in modern and contemporary movements: [Georges Braque](/artist/georges-braque)'s Cubist paintings featured words tucked between lines of fractured geometry, while [Roy Lichtenstein](/artist/roy-lichtenstein)'s cartoonish [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art) paintings often contained quote bubbles. Conceptual art up to the present has made heavy use of texts, as seen in [Joseph Kosuth](/artist/joseph-kosuth)'s dictionary definitions, [Jenny Holzer](/artist/jenny-holzer)'s \"truisms\", and [Lawrence Weiner](/artist/lawrence-weiner)'s wall pieces.",

      "description": "_\u201cSculpture is the art of the hole and the lump.\u201d \u2014[Auguste Rodin](/artist/auguste-rodin)_\n\nFrom the Parthenon frieze and the Easter Island _maoi_ to the Chinese Terracotta Warriors and the prehistoric _Venus of Willendorf_, sculpture is a medium as diverse as it is ancient. Traditionally worked in natural materials like stone, clay, and metal, sculpture encompasses both free-standing works \u201cin-the-round\u201d and reliefs, often serving as architectural elements. Sharing the viewer\u2019s space more literally than any other medium, sculpture has given rise to some of the most iconic works in art history, including the classical Greek _Venus de Milo_ (c. 130-100 B.C.), [Michelangelo](/artist/michelangelo-buonarroti)\u2019s [High Renaissance](/gene/high-renaissance) _David_ (1504), Rodin\u2019s _The Thinker_ (1902), and [Constantin Brancusi](/artist/constantin-brancusi)\u2019s [_The Kiss_](/artwork/constantin-brancusi-the-kiss-le-baiser) (1908). The 20th century saw the explosion of traditional sculpture, wherein virtually any material\u2014like [John Chamberlain](/artist/john-chamberlain)\u2019s car parts or [Marcel Duchamp](/artist/marcel-duchamp)\u2019s readymades\u2014could be used, as well as the rise of such diverse movements as [kinetic sculpture](/gene/kinetic-sculpture), sound sculpture, environmental art, and [Minimalist](/gene/minimalism) sculpture.",
