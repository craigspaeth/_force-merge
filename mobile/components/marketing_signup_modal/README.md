## Usage

This uses config variables to determine where it's applied. Use `heroku config:set` to configure a campaign. e.g. Set `MARKETING_SIGNUP_MODAL_SLUG=miami` to allow the query param ?m-id=miami to be added to any page for a modal to appear.

Examples:

````
MARKETING_SIGNUP_MODAL_SLUG=miami
MARKETING_SIGNUP_MODAL_COPY=Sign up for early access
MARKETING_SIGNUP_MODAL_IMG=http://placekitten.com/200/200
````

If this expirment results in a worthwhile amount of collector acquistion then eventually the idea is we will replace this config data with a tool we give Marketing to manage themselves.

## Implementation

This is implemented globally in our layout component by checking against the config variables added to sharify.
