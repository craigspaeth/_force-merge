Compared to the conga line of international art fairs that can feel repetitive and rote, SPRING/BREAK’s spontaneous energy was refreshing, leading this reporter to spend five (largely enjoyable) hours perusing around 80 exhibitions and performances organized by some 90 curators.&nbsp;</p>",

The word alludes to many concepts—like currency, exchange, collaboration, and transformation—and all definitions are explored in the storied Farley Post Office building (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/nyregion/progress-is-made-in-plan-to-convert-post-office-into-penn-station-annex.html?_r=0\">soon to be Moynihan Station</a>) that houses SPRING/BREAK for the first time this year. One specific interpretation, however, set the tone for a day of candid and unexpected experiences. During an afternoon gathering in the cavernous stairwell that connects the fair’s two floors, Kelly emerged in a white dress and walked through the crowd toward Gori. As it turns out, Kelly and Gori are in love and were married right there, on the spot. The founders had just set their project in motion with a mischievous, moving, and legally legitimate transaction.</p>"

Featuring some 400 artists, projects range from playful to serious, transportive to grounded, and fresh to overly familiar. They are discovered by traveling down long hallways and entering rooms that differ in size and color. Some presentations are tucked into hidden vaults, others integrated into spaces labeled “Consumer Affairs Office,” covered with checkered linoleum floors, or bordered by windows that are much-appreciated by weathered fairgoers used to a steady stream of cubicle booths. In short, the five-hour experience felt like a walk through a life-size cabinet of curiosities—one focused on art and accented with an idiosyncratic setting, mellow crowd, and great snacks (popcorn, espresso, oysters).&nbsp;</p>"

Both are by Philip Garner, a conceptual artist known for his 1982 catalogue of aspirational lifestyle products, <i>Philip Garner’s Better Living Catalogue.</i> In the mid-1980s, Garner transitioned from Philip to Pippa and several more recent works by Pippa are also on view. Intrigued parties take note: Pippa is rumored to be joining Parker in the booth for the remainder of the fair.</p>"
